From the command line:

1. Clone files from this repository by typing the following in command line:

    `git clone https://github.com/Luke-kb/FLEXTRACK.git`

2. Install Bundler if you don't already have it installed.

    `gem install bundler`

3. Navigate to the `src` folder eg FLEXTRACK/projects/terminal-app/src

4. Next run the `run-app.sh` 

    This will intall all dependencies and then run the application.
   
    You can do this by clicking and dragging the run-app.sh file from your file explorer into your terminal (which then shows the path to the file) and hitting Enter. Alternatively, if you know the path to the file from your current directory you can type it in manually.

5. Once you have run the app using `run-app.sh` if you wish the run the app again you can simply navigate to the `src` folder of the repo and type `ruby app.rb` and hit enter.

6. In addition, adding a `-g` flag after the filename will initiate GOD mode. Do this by typing `ruby app.rb -g`
