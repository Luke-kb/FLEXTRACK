Realised that the countries gem was not going to work as expected. The information provided was not extensive enough, and required too much hard coding to provide questions. Some googling took me to the Open Trivia Database. This made everything simpler as the multiple choice answer and other options were all contained in an object. 
To make the data fetching process simpler decided to use HTTParty gem.
